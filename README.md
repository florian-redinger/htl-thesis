# htl-thesis

This is the thesis of a installation software creation tool, which allows employees to create installation software for TGW-Systems (Software and Storage Systems)
quickly.
With this it was no longer necessary to create installation software for every project explicitly.
The complete SourceCode cannot be provided for legal reasons.
(Even though it is called a diploma thesis, it is not comparably to a thesis at a university)

This project was created by three people:
  - Florian Peter
  - Andreas Wageneder
  - Florian Redinger (Team Lead)
